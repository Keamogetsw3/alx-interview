### What is Pascal’s triangle
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d08e2744-7d2e-4492-9fcf-ca5d76785fdf)

- Pascal's triangle, in algebra, a triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression, such as (x + y)n.
- A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.

### What are Python Algorithms
- Python algorithms provide a detailed set of instructions by which you can process data for a specific purpose.
- Python can use a wide variety of algorithms, but some of the most well-known are tree traversal, sorting, search and graph algorithms.

  - Tree traversal algorithms are designed to visit all nodes of a tree graph, starting from the root and traversing each node according to the instructions laid out. Traversal can occur in order, with the algorithm traversing the tree from node to edge (branches), or from the edges to the root.
  - Sorting algorithms provide various ways of arranging data in a particular format, with common algorithms including bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort and shell sort.
  - Searching algorithms check and retrieve elements from different data structures, with variations including linear search and binary search.
  - Graph algorithms traverse graphs from their edges in a depth-first (DFS) or breadth-first (BFS) manner.
- How to Write a Python Algorithm: 6 Characteristics
  - It is unambiguous and has clear steps.
  - The algorithm has zero or more well-defined inputs.
  - It must have one or more defined outputs.
  - The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
  - It must be feasible and exist using available resources.
  - The algorithm should be written independently of all programming code.

### 1. Lists and List Comprehensions:

- create, access, modify, and iterate over lists:
  ```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
- 
Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
Functions:

Know how to define and call functions.
Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
Loops:

Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
Conditional Statements:

Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
Recursion (Optional):

While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.
Arithmetic Operations:

Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.
Indexing and Slicing:

Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.
Memory Management:

Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.
Error and Exception Handling (Optional):

Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.
Efficiency and Optimization:

Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
By revisiting these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal’s Triangle in Python, applying both your mathematical understanding and programming skills to develop an efficient and effective solution.
