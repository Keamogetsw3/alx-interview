### What is Pascalâ€™s triangle
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d08e2744-7d2e-4492-9fcf-ca5d76785fdf)

- Pascal's triangle, in algebra, a triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression, such as (x + y)n.
- A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.

### What are Python Algorithms
- Python algorithms provide a detailed set of instructions by which you can process data for a specific purpose.
- Python can use a wide variety of algorithms, but some of the most well-known are tree traversal, sorting, search and graph algorithms.

  - Tree traversal algorithms are designed to visit all nodes of a tree graph, starting from the root and traversing each node according to the instructions laid out. Traversal can occur in order, with the algorithm traversing the tree from node to edge (branches), or from the edges to the root.
  - Sorting algorithms provide various ways of arranging data in a particular format, with common algorithms including bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort and shell sort.
  - Searching algorithms check and retrieve elements from different data structures, with variations including linear search and binary search.
  - Graph algorithms traverse graphs from their edges in a depth-first (DFS) or breadth-first (BFS) manner.
- How to Write a Python Algorithm: 6 Characteristics
  - It is unambiguous and has clear steps.
  - The algorithm has zero or more well-defined inputs.
  - It must have one or more defined outputs.
  - The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
  - It must be feasible and exist using available resources.
  - The algorithm should be written independently of all programming code.
