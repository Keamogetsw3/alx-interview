### What is Pascal’s triangle
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d08e2744-7d2e-4492-9fcf-ca5d76785fdf)

- Pascal's triangle, in algebra, a triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression, such as (x + y)n.
- A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.

### What are Python Algorithms
- Algorithm has a set of instructions or procedures, designed to achieve a specific goal.
- It can be simple, involving a sequence of basic operations or complex following a multi-step process with different data structures and logic.
- Overview of the Algorithms: 

  - Sorting algorithms: These algorithms are essential for organizing data efficiently.
  - Search algorithms: They are key for finding elements in large datasets. Examples include binary search and hash tables.
  - Graph algorithms: They are used for solving graph-related challenges, like finding the shortest path or checking   connectivity. Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, and Dijkstra’s algorithm.
  - Dynamic programming: Think of it as a technique used for breaking down problems into simpler, more manageable chunks to avoid extra work. Fibonacci Sequence and Bellman-Ford algorithm.
  - Greedy algorithms: They are used to solve optimization challenges by making the best choice at each step, even if it doesn't guarantee the absolute best outcome in the long run. A prominent example is Huffman coding.
  - Backtracking: They aim to explore all possible combinations, getting rid of paths that don’t lead to an effective solution. WN-Queens problem .
