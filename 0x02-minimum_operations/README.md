# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description
This project focuses on developing an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters in a text editor using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste." The solution should be efficient and adhere to specific algorithmic concepts like dynamic programming, prime factorization, and greedy algorithms.

## Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems to build up a solution efficiently.
- **Prime Factorization**: The sum of the prime factors of `n` plays a crucial role in determining the minimum number of operations.
- **Code Optimization**: Identifying the most efficient way to solve the problem.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Choosing the best immediate solution at each step to minimize operations.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Implementing the solution using Python functions, loops, and conditionals.

## Project Requirements
- **Language**: Python (version 3.4.3)
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Style**: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
- **Execution**: All Python files must be executable and begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## File Structure
- `README.md`: This file.
- Python script files for implementing the algorithm.
  
## General Rules
- All files must end with a new line.
- All files must be properly documented with clear and concise explanations.
- Adherence to the PEP 8 style guide is mandatory.

## Resources
Here are some resources to help you understand the key concepts involved:
- [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org)
- [How to optimize Python code](https://realpython.com/python-code-optimization/)
- [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
- [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Example
If the desired number of characters is `9`, the minimum number of operations would be `6`. You copy all the text once, and then paste it multiple times based on the prime factors of `9` (i.e., 3 * 3).
