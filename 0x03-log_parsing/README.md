## Project Overview

For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.

### Concepts Needed:
1. **File I/O in Python**:
   - Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
   - Resources: [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

2. **Signal Handling in Python**:
   - Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
   - Resources: [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
   - Aggregating data to compute summaries.

4. **Regular Expressions**:
   - Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
   - Resources: [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

5. **Dictionaries in Python**:
   - Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
   - Resources: [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
   - Resources: [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
