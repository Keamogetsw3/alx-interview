## Project Overview
The **“0x05. N Queens”** project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the **backtracking algorithm** to place **N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard**. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Concepts Needed
### Backtracking Algorithms
- Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

  - **Resource**: Backtracking Introduction

### Recursion
- Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

  - **Resource**: Recursion in Python

### List Manipulations in Python
- Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

  - **Resource**: Python Lists

### Python Command Line Arguments
- Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.

  - **Resource**: Command Line Arguments in Python

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.

## Additional Resources
- **Mock Interview**
