'''2D Matrix Rotation Module.

This module provides a function to rotate a square 2D matrix by 90 degrees 
clockwise in-place.
'''

def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    '''Rotates a 2D matrix 90Â° clockwise in place.

    Args:
        matrix (list of list of int): A square 2D matrix to be rotated.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is rotated in place, no new matrix is returned.

    This function rotates the matrix in place by performing a series of swaps 
    for each "layer" of the matrix. Each element is moved to its new position 
    as part of a cycle (four elements are swapped at a time).

            top, bottom = left, right  # Set the bounds for the current layer

            # Save the value at the top-left corner of the current layer
