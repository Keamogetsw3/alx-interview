# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves implementing an **in-place algorithm** to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The task requires a strong understanding of **matrix manipulation** and **in-place operations** in Python. By completing this project, you will enhance your skills in handling 2D data structures and optimizing algorithms to minimize space complexity.

## Learning Objectives

To successfully complete this project, you need to understand and apply the following concepts:

### 1. Matrix Representation in Python
- 2D matrices are represented using **lists of lists** in Python.
- Learn to **access** and **modify** elements in a 2D matrix.

### 2. In-place Operations
- Perform operations directly on the original data structure, avoiding additional memory usage.
- Understand the importance of reducing **space complexity**.

### 3. Matrix Transposition
- Swap rows and columns to transpose the matrix.
- Implement transposition as a key step in the rotation process.

### 4. Reversing Rows
- Reverse the order of elements in each row after transposition to achieve rotation.

### 5. Nested Loops
- Use nested loops to traverse and modify elements within a 2D matrix.
