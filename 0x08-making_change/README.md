## Project Overview

The **“0. Change comes from within”** project challenges you to solve a classic problem in dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the **coin change problem**.  

### Objective:
Find the **minimum number of coins** required to make up a given total amount using a list of coin denominations. This project focuses on developing a solution that is both **correct** and **efficient**, applying algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Greedy Algorithms
- Understand how greedy algorithms operate and why they are often suitable for the coin change problem.
- Identify limitations of greedy approaches, especially when they may not yield optimal solutions.

### 2. Dynamic Programming
- Learn the basic principles of dynamic programming for solving optimization problems.
- Explore the concepts of **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**, particularly in the context of coin change.

### 3. Algorithmic Complexity
- Analyze the **time** and **space complexity** of various approaches.
- Optimize your solution to meet runtime constraints.

### 4. Problem-Solving Strategies
- Break the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Explore iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

### 5. Python Programming
- Manipulate lists and implement list comprehensions effectively.
- Write functions using efficient loops and conditional statements.
